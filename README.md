# Aeroplane-Radar-System
The Aeroplane Radar System is a C++ program designed for educational and simulation purposes.
It demonstrates how a radar system on an aircraft could work by detecting nearby objects, providing the current location of the aeroplane, and generating a concise summary report of detected data.




Features

1. Object Detection

Simulates the detection of objects (e.g., other aircraft, mountains, weather clouds) within a defined radar range.

Displays object name, distance, and relative direction.

Uses random or user-defined data to create realistic radar readings.


2. Aeroplane Location Tracking

Keeps track of the aircraft’s simulated latitude, longitude, and altitude.

Updates position as the plane “moves” during the simulation.

Displays data in a readable format for quick situational awareness.


3. Summary Report Generation

Generates a small summary report at the end of the simulation.

Includes:

Total objects detected

Closest and farthest object

Average detection distance

Final location of the aeroplane
